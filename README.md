ProjectBoard
------------

ProjectBoard Birthed out of the need to track ideas for projects within the
Tyler Web Dev organization. Since, we being developers, needed a solution that
could of been solved via a notepad, we designed an entire program for tracking
projects, their status, and contributors.

### Setting up a Development Environment
1. Get the codebase `git clone https://github.com/TylerWebDev/ProjectBoard.git`
2. Enter the newly made directory `cd ProjectBoard/`
3. Get the necessary dependencies `npm install`
4. Start up the server `npm start`
  * If you want to run the website tethered to the console (great for debuging), run `node bin/ProjectBoard`
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3012`
